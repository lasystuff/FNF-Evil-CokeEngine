### Object-oriented Lua Scripting ~~(so its better than Psych Engine)~~
Most of the characters, some stages, events etc are loaded using lua.

### Others
- Full-fledged modchart functions
    - Based on **FNF In The Galaxy** and **Andromeda Engine** (+ Schmoovin)
    ```lua
    modchart:set_percent("drunk", 100 , -1) -- you can do this thing and something lol check scenes/nodes/modchart folder on source
    ```
- Highly optimized note rendering with implemented cue system and tiled sustained notes
- A pretty decent input system based from original research from Vanilla, FPS Plus, Psych, and Osu!Mania
- ~~Overly~~ organized character debugger etc...
